[Verse 1]
Goodbye always starts with hello
That's why I don't trust anyone that walks through the door
But I'd throw that out the window
I'm just gonna pretend this gone end on a good note
But it's not a good note
It's never a good note
But I'll keep my eyes closed

[Chorus]
I can't see
The end so I pretend it's sweet
Until it crashes down
I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out for me
No, no, no, I don't wanna see
It all come crashing down
I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah, but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out

[Verse 2]
Hello always ends with goodbye
How would I know the steps ? If I don't even try?
We make believe it's fun sometimes
So I keep pretending it's gonna end on a good note
But it's not a good note
It's never a good note
But I'll keep my eyes closed
Pretend like I don't know
How this is gonna go
'Cause it's not a good note
It's never a good note

[Chorus]
I can't see
The end so I pretend it's sweet
Until it crashes down
I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out for me
No, no, no, I don't wanna see
It all come crashing down
I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah, but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out

[Bridge]
Oh

[Chorus]
I can't see
The end so I pretend it's sweet
Until it crashes down
I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out for me
No, no, no, I don't wanna see
It all come crashing down
I know it's gonna crash down
Yeah, but not right now
It's kinda funny how it all works out
